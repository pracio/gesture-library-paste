=====================

Exploring new types of interaction by mixing EyeX, Leap Motion, Depth Camera and Touch Screen together!

As we know input devices above usually consumes a lot of computing power, so carefully choosing the programming language in this project is very important.
I chose CLR/C++ because I need the core of the project to be fast and the user interface can be easily implemented.
My ultimate goal is to deliver a tool for interaction designers where they can tweak and merge different types of interaction easily for their user study.
